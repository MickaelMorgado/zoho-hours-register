# Product Context: Zoho Hours Register

## Why This Project Exists
Time tracking for project-based work is essential but often cumbersome. Zoho users need a streamlined way to log hours against specific tasks without switching between multiple interfaces. Manual time entry is error-prone and time-consuming, leading to inaccurate project tracking and billing.

## Problems Solved
- **Inefficient Time Logging**: Eliminates the need to manually track time and then separately log it in Zoho
- **Task Association Errors**: Reduces mistakes in associating time entries with the correct project tasks
- **Context Switching**: Provides an integrated experience within a dedicated dashboard
- **Productivity Loss**: Minimizes the overhead of time tracking so users focus on actual work

## How It Should Work
1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via Zoho OAuth for seamless access
2. **Project Overview**: Dashboard displays all accessible Zoho projects with summary metrics
3. **Timer Activation**: Quick timer start from sidebar for any activity
4. **Log Management**: Pending time entries remain visible until confirmed with descriptions
5. **Smart Matching**: System analyzes descriptions to suggest the most appropriate Zoho task
6. **Confirmation & Sync**: User confirms the match, and time is logged directly to Zoho

## User Experience Goals
- **Frictionless**: Start timer with one click, minimal steps to log time
- **Intelligent**: Task matching feels smart and accurate, with easy overrides
- **Transparent**: Clear visibility into pending logs and project status
- **Reliable**: Works offline for timer functionality, syncs when online
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes for use on various devices

## Target Users
- Project managers and team members using Zoho for project management
- Freelancers and consultants billing by the hour
- Development teams requiring accurate time tracking for client projects
- Organizations needing precise project cost tracking
